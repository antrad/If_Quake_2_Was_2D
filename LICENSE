If Quake 2 Was 2D - licensing information
=======================================

My Unnamed Game(MUG) engine is a heavily modified engine from the book Advanced 2D Game Development (2008) by J.S. Harbour.

There are only few files that contain mostly original code from the Advanced 2D Engine located in the Engine folder:
Advanced2D.h,Advanced2D.cpp
Entity.h,Entity.cpp
Math.h,Math.cpp
Sprite.h,Sprite.cpp
Texture.h,Texture.cpp
Timer.h,Timer.cpp
Vector3.h,Vector3.cpp
winmain.h,winmain.cpp
I'm not sure about these 4 anymore, they are probably a mix, but everything else in the folder is my code:
AR_Direct3D.h,AR_Direct3D.cpp
AR_DirectInput.h,Ar_DirectInput.cpp

Mr. Harbour stated the following about the license:
"The source code is protected under copyright but that only applies to re-publishing the sources in another book or article or web site without citing the reference."

There are a bunch of FMOD files left in the repository in the engine folder, copyright of Firelight Technologies:
fmod.h,fmod.hpp,fmod_codec.h,fmod_dsp.h,fmod_errors.h,fmod_output.h
Check www.fmod.org for more info about their software licensing.

So, as for my code... DO WHAT THE F*** YOU WANT TO !
